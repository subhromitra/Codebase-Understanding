# Codebase-Understanding using Multi-Agent framework

• Designed a Custom Multi-Agent Framework to analyze and understand large Python codebases via static analysis, dependency graph resolution, and modular agent coordination (Planner, Memory, Static, Query, etc.). <br>
• Distilled a 7B Qwen2.5-Coder model into a compact 1.5B version to improve inference efficiency while retaining summarization capabilities for source code understanding. <br>
• Evaluated summarization quality using a quantized 14B model in LLM-as-a-Judge setup to assess coherence, correctness, and completeness of function-level explanations.
